**statistical learning spring 2023**

Using decision trees and naive bayes to classify maternal health risk using the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. [Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Maternal+Health+Risk+Data+Set)

The data was collected from different hospitals, community clinics, and maternal health centers from the rural areas of Bangladesh through the IoT based risk monitoring system. 
See the inlcuded report PDF where I include details of the project and my output.
